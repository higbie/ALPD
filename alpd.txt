PREFACE

The AMERICAN LABOR PRESS DIRECTORY, now put at the service of the labor movement of the country, is the first publication of its kind to appear. Labor paper lists, exceed ingly incomplete and hard to obtain, have occasionally been circulated in the past. The present DIRECTORY covers a wider field, and gives more information about the papers it lists, than any of its predecessors. If it succeeds in meeting the need which apparently exists for it, it will be revised each year.

In addition to papers issued directly by or in the name of trade unions and labor political groups of all shades of opinion, certain other types of journals have been included. All known periodicals of the cooperative movement are listed. So also are social science, liberal, religious, and gov ernmental publications if they deal with labor problems. The roster of General Labor papers, the longest single list in the DIRECTORY, contains the numerous local journals issued by city central trades councils, voluntary groups, or individuals, which in any way claim to speak in the interests of the

o, workers.

v

Labor journals are notoriously short-lived. Yet in look-

J ing over tht descriptions of the 60Q, American and Canadian

r papers for which detailed information is given, one is struck

3^ with the fact that many of the stronger and more ably man-

^ aged have survived for a quarter century or longer. While

^ every effort has been made to get the information up-to-date,

some of the newest journals may have escaped our search,

3 and a few of those listed may have suspended. The Labor

b* Research Department would be indebted for authoritative

corrections. Circulation figures given are not sworn state ments, and are not intended for commercial purposes.

While the DIRECTORY is primarily concerned with the United States and Canada, the most important International labor papers, and those published in Other Countries, are given in special sections. These lists are substantially the same as those in the American Labor Year Book, which is also issued by the Labor Research Department. For ampli fying the lists there printed, and gathering the fuller infor mation which the present volume contains in its American and Canadian sections, credit is due to Nathan Fine of the Department staff.

The compilation of these useful data could never have been accomplished without the courtesy, good will, and co operation of the many editors and managers of the papers concerned. To them all the Labor Research Department

wishes to extend its hearty thanks.
